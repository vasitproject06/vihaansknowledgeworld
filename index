            <h1>Basics of Space</h2>
                <br>
            🌌 What Is Space?

Space begins roughly 100 km (62 miles) above Earth at the Kármán line. It has:

No breathable air

Extremely low pressure (near vacuum)

Extreme temperatures (very hot in sunlight, very cold in shade)
<br>
<br>

🌍 Major Components of Space
<br>
1. Planets

Bodies that orbit a star and are large enough to be round.

In our Solar System: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

Divided into rocky planets and gas/ice giants
<br>
2. Stars

Massive balls of glowing gas (mostly hydrogen and helium).

Our star is the Sun

Stars produce energy through nuclear fusion
<br>
3. Moons

Natural satellites that orbit planets.

Earth has one; Jupiter and Saturn have dozens
<br>
4. Asteroids & Comets

Asteroids: rocky objects, mostly between Mars and Jupiter

Comets: icy bodies that form glowing tails when near the Sun
<br>
5. Galaxies

Huge systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.

Our galaxy: the Milky Way

There are billions of galaxies in the universe
<br>
<br>
🌠 The Universe

Everything that exists: space, time, matter, and energy

Estimated age: ~13.8 billion years

Expanding since the Big Bang
<img src="spaceweb1.png" alt="The Universe" width="200px" style="float:right; margin-left:20px; border-radius:10px;">
<br>
<br>
🛰️ Human Activity in Space

Satellites: communication, GPS, weather

Space stations: International Space Station (ISS)

Exploration: Moon landings, Mars rovers, space telescopes (like Hubble & James Webb)
<br>
<br>

❓Big Questions About Space

<h1>Is there life beyond Earth?</h1> <br>We are not sure if there is life elsewhere in the universe, but scientists are actively searching for signs of microbial life on Mars and the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The discovery of exoplanets in habitable zones around other stars also raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
<br>
<br>
<h1>What are dark matter and dark energy?</h1><br>🕶️ Dark Matter

What it is:

An invisible form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light

Makes up about 27% of the universe

How we know it exists:

Galaxies rotate too fast to be held together by visible matter alone

Gravitational effects show there is extra unseen mass

What it does:

Acts like cosmic glue, holding galaxies and galaxy clusters together

What it's made of:

Unknown

Not atoms, not stars, not planets

Possibly exotic particles we haven't detected yet
<br>
<br>
🌠 Dark Energy

What it is:

A mysterious force causing the expansion of the universe to speed up

Makes up about 68% of the universe

Discovery:

In 1998, scientists found distant galaxies were moving away faster than expected

What it does:

Pushes space itself apart

Opposes gravity on very large scales

What it is exactly:

Completely unknown

Could be a property of space itself (often linked to “vacuum energy”)
<br>
<br>
⚖️ Dark Matter vs Dark Energy
Feature	Dark Matter	Dark Energy
Visible?	❌ No	❌ No
Effect	Pulls things together	Pushes universe apart
Role	Forms galaxies	Accelerates expansion
% of universe	~27%	~68%
<br>
<br>
🤯 The Big Picture

Everything we can see — stars, planets, people — makes up only about 5% of the universe.

The rest is dark matter and dark energy, meaning:

Most of the universe is made of things we don't yet understand.
<br>
<br>
<img src="spaceweb2.png" alt="A nebula" width="250px" style="float:left; margin-right:20px; border-radius:10px;">
<br>
<br>
<h1>How will the universe end?</h1>

    Cosmologists don't know for sure how the universe will end, but based on current evidence there are a few leading scenarios. Which one happens depends mainly on dark energy and how it behaves over time.
<br>
1. Heat Death (Big Freeze) — Most likely

This is the leading model today.

The universe keeps expanding forever.

Galaxies drift apart until new stars can no longer form.

Existing stars burn out; black holes slowly evaporate.

Eventually, the universe becomes cold, dark, and extremely dilute.

End state: Maximum entropy, near absolute zero, no usable energy.
Timescale: Trillions to googols of years.
<br>
<br>
2. Big Rip

If dark energy grows stronger over time:

Expansion accelerates uncontrollably.

Galaxies, stars, planets, and eventually atoms are torn apart.

Spacetime itself is ripped.

End state: Everything is shredded.
Timescale: Possibly tens of billions of years (if this is correct).
<br>
<br>
3. Big Crunch

If gravity eventually overcomes expansion:

Expansion reverses.

The universe collapses back on itself.

Density and temperature rise toward a final singularity.

End state: A hot, dense collapse—possibly a reverse Big Bang.
Status: Currently disfavored by observations.
<br>
<br>
4. Big Bounce

A variation of the Big Crunch:

Collapse triggers a new expansion.

Our universe may be one cycle in an endless sequence.

Status: Speculative, but explored in quantum gravity theories.
<br>
<br>
5. Vacuum Decay

A more exotic possibility:

Our universe may be in a “false vacuum.”

A quantum event could trigger a transition to a lower-energy state.

A bubble of new physics expands at near light speed, rewriting reality.

End state: Unknown—laws of physics would change instantly.

What do observations suggest?

Measurements of:

Cosmic expansion

Cosmic microwave background

Dark energy (≈70% of the universe)

currently favor eternal expansion, making heat death the most probable outcome.

            <h2>Origins & History</h2>
<h3>Cricket originated in England in the late 16th century.

The first international cricket match was played in 1844 between the USA and Canada.

Test cricket, the oldest format, began in 1877 (England vs Australia).

The Ashes series started in 1882 after Australia beat England at The Oval.

Cricket spread globally through the British Empire.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Basic Rules & Gameplay</h2>
<h3>
A cricket match is played between two teams of 11 players.

Each team takes turns to bat and bowl.

The batting team scores runs; the bowling team tries to dismiss batters.

A match is played on a circular or oval field with a 22-yard pitch.

There are three wooden stumps topped by two bails at each end.

A batter is out if the bails are dislodged (with some exceptions).</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Ways a Batter Can Be Out</h2>
<h3>
Bowled,

Caught,

Leg Before Wicket (LBW),

Run out,

Stumped,

Hit wicket,

Handled the ball (now merged into “obstructing the field”)and

Timed out (very rare)</h3>
<img src="cricketweb2.png" alt="Batter being bowled" width="300px" style="float:right; margin-left:20px; border-radius:10px;">
<br>
<br>
<h2>Formats of Cricket</h2>
<h3>
Test Cricket: Up to 5 days, unlimited overs.

One Day Internationals (ODIs): 50 overs per side.

T20 Cricket: 20 overs per side, lasts about 3 hours.

The Hundred (England): 100 balls per side.

T10 Cricket: 10 overs per side, very fast-paced.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Scoring Facts</h2>
<h3>A batter can score 1–6 runs per ball (or more via overthrows).

A six is scored when the ball clears the boundary without bouncing.

A four is scored when the ball reaches the boundary after bouncing.

An over consists of 6 legal deliveries.

Extras include no-balls, wides, byes, and leg byes.</h3>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<h3>Cricket bats are traditionally made of English willow.

Balls are made of leather with a cork core.

Cricket balls are usually red (Tests), white (ODIs/T20s), or pink (day-night Tests).

Players wear protective gear like pads, gloves, helmets, and boxes.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Fielding Facts</h2>
<h3>There are 11 fielders, including the wicketkeeper.

Only two fielders are allowed behind square on the leg side.

Catching the ball cleanly without it touching the ground dismisses the batter.

A fielder can throw the ball to hit the stumps for a run out.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Bowling Facts</h2>
<h3>Bowlers must keep their arm straight when delivering the ball.

Fast bowlers can exceed 150 km/h (93 mph).

Spin bowlers use wrist or finger rotation to deceive batters.

Types of bowling include fast, swing, seam, off-spin, leg-spin.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Famous Players</h2>
<h3>Sir Don Bradman (Australia) had a Test batting average of 99.94.

Sachin Tendulkar is the highest run-scorer in international cricket.

Muttiah Muralitharan has the most Test wickets (800).

Jacques Kallis is one of the greatest all-rounders.

MS Dhoni is one of the most successful captains.
Virat Kohli is my favorite player!</h3>
<img src="cricketweb1.png" border-radius="10px" alt="Virat Kohli batting" width="300px" style="float:right; margin-left:20px;">
<br>
<br>
<h2>Records & Milestones</h2>
<h3>Highest individual Test score: 400* (Brian Lara).

Fastest century in ODIs: 31 balls (AB de Villiers).

First double century in ODIs: Sachin Tendulkar.

Most sixes in international cricket: Chris Gayle.

Longest Test match lasted 12 days (1939, timeless Test).</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>World Cups & Major Tournaments</h2>
<h3>The ICC Cricket World Cup began in 1975.

Australia has won the most Cricket World Cups.

The T20 World Cup began in 2007.

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the richest cricket league.

The Big Bash League (BBL) is Australia's T20 league.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Countries Where Cricket Is Popular</h2>
<h3>India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh

England, Australia, New Zealand

South Africa, West Indies

Afghanistan, Ireland</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Strategy & Tactics</h2>
<h3>Captains decide the batting order and field placements.

Pitch conditions affect how much the ball spins or swings.

Weather and light can impact play.

Reverse swing occurs when one side of the ball is rougher than the other.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Fun & Unusual Facts</h2>
<h3>A batter can be not out even after scoring 0 (a “duck”).

There are different types of ducks: golden duck, diamond duck.

Matches can end in a tie, draw, or no result.

A hat-trick is three wickets in three consecutive balls.

Umpires can give batters out using DRS (Decision Review System).

Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world by fan base.</h3>
